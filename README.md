# DACore
Core UI Framework shared across all native/spritekit iOS apps.

1) Check out the project you want to use (Little Broken Robots, Lightning Makes Babies, any iOS Client Project)
2) Check out this project
3) Create an XCode workspace and drag both XCode projects into the workspace.
4) In each project that uses DACore, click on that project's folder, right-click, and click "Add Files to..."
5) Choose the DACore folder and make it a folder reference.
6) Compile and go!


TODO: Static swift frameworks currently only support iOS 8+, so once we're not worried about iOS 7 any more we can do the legwork for making this an actual compiled framework (make all the fields public)
